      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The project consists in multiple services, each with their own
        functionality, thus creating the SOA architecture. Those services can be
        clustered into 4 categories: front end, back end, data related and
        database.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application exposes all of its features to the user with the help of
        HTML5 pages loaded with dynamic and static data. The pages will be
        offered through the BeM Frontend service. The data will come through the
        Gateway Service, a service to which the Frontend will make all the
        requests. The gateway will further ask for data from other services that
        have their own way to query and format data from the database.

        Our application will use a single knowledge base both for user and
        beverages (meta-)data storage. This knowledge base will interact with
        our Search & Filter, Beverage Profile, User Profile and Recommendations
        services. The process of data collection is described in section 8,
        whereas the steps for creating the knowledge base are discussed in
        section 10. A description of the ontological model is given in section
        9.

      <h2>Final Users</h2>
      <p>
        The target for the application was to have a place where people can
        search with ease through beverages and find offers, recipes, reviews or
        even other users. By completing some of the preferential user fields,
        such as nationality, age or preferred beverages, the users will also be
        able to regularly find beverages, offers, other users or reviews that
        are more suited to them. Instead of searching each time for a specific
        topic, the user will be presented with the option of checking a feed of
        recommendations in which popular or personally customized user or
        beverage related data can be seen. The application acts as a powerful
        beverage based search tool in which people interact with beverage data
        and each other by doing actions only related to beverages.

          formatted and sent back to the Beverage Manager Gateway.

          The task flow diagram below describes the steps and decisions that a
          user has to make in order to perform searches and apply filters. If a
          user searches for a beverage, he can do this by using combinations of
          11 criteria (criteria are given in the left side of the diagram). The
          process of filtering is done using the same criteria as the process of
          searching (and this is true also in case of recipes, offers, reviews).
          If a user searches for a recipe, he can use combinations of 7 search
          criteria (criteria are given in the right side of the diagram). In
          case of offers there are 9 different search criteria, while in the
          case of reviews there are 8 different search criteria. As a mention,
          when searching (or applying filters) for offers and reviews, the users
          have the possibility to search/filter after information corresponding
          to users that added the offer / review.

        <p>
          The Item Recommendations service provides a way to obtain
          recommendations on any item for a specific user. By default it
          provides recommendations based on popularity, but by requesting to
          take a user into account, it can provide customized recommendations
          based on that User's Beverage Profile. The data can be accessed
          through request given to the exposed REST API.

          Considerations, expresiveness and integration aspects regarding the designed ontological model (<b>updated</b>)
        </h3>
        <p>
          We described categories of beverages through a hierarchy of classes
          (corresponding to categories from table 1). We opted for this type of
          modelling in order to ensure an easy extension of the ontology in the
          future, in case of adding other subcategories or categories of drinks.
          The root class of this taxonomy is class Beverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case of beverages such as juices and nectar we decided to define
          subcategories by splitting these beverages based on the kind(s) of
          fruits and/or vegetables they contain (ex: AppleJuice, PearNectar,
          etc.). We correlated these subclasses with classes Fruit and Vegetable
          through object properties isMadeOfFruit and isMadeOfVegetable. Figure
          9.B highlights the subclasses representing types of beverages:

        <p>
          Next, we will provide a general overview of classes and their
          associated properties (data properties and object properties) we used
          in our model:
        </p>
        <ul id="ontology-description-classes-and-properties">
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class Person</span>. Models the user
            information. This class is connected through object properties with
            classes Nationality, Country, HealthRestriction, meaning that a user
            with a certain nationality lives in a certain country and may have
            some health restrictions (such as lactose intolerance or diabetes).
            We also defined object properties to express the fact that a user
            may have one or more beverage preferences and/or one or more
            beverage category preferences (for example: a user prefers
            plant-based products). Person is also connected to classes Recipe,
            Offer and Review with object properties that express the fact that a
            user can add a review for a beverage, make a beverage offer or add
            scores for beverages and recipes. We will present below a mechanism
            for expressing the association between users, scores and
            beverages/recipes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">classes Country and Nationality</span>.
            Useful for describing beverage provenance, the country where a user
            lives in or the user’s nationality. Therefore, both the residence
            country and nationality of the user are taken into account, in order
            to increase the expressiveness of our model.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class Health Restriction</span>.
            Indicated health restrictions of users, such as intolerances to certain 
            ingredients/substances (lactose, caffeine, gluten, fructose), certain diseases and 
            health conditions that impact or are highly impacted by alimentation (eg.: diabetes, cancer).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class HealthLabel</span>. Defines the
            health labels that are used to describe beverages and recipes.
            Health labels indicate the existence or non-existence of an
            important or potentially dangerous ingredient in the beverage or a
            certain property of the beverage, for example: milk-free,
            for-vegans, guarana-extract, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class Ingredient</span>. Associated
            with classes Beverage and Recipe, describes the ingredients that a
            beverage/recipe can have. Ingredients have a different naming
            convention from beverages and recipes, in order to avoid ambiguity
            (ex: water as beverage or as ingredient).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class Category</span>. Defines the
            fine-grained categories that a beverage can belong to. We used the
            hierarchy of classes for defining main classes of beverages, but we
            also needed a mechanism to associate more expressive and/or detailed
            categories to beverages (such as squeezed-juices, instant-coffees,
            flavoured-syrups, etc.). These categories have been previously
            collected from the data extracted from Open Food Facts. It was
            almost impossible and impractical to model all of those categories
            as a set of classes, so we decided to create this new class to
            capture the small categories that a beverage can have. In this way
            we increased the expressiveness of our model.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class Beverage</span>. We associated
            this class with classes Review and Recipe and Offer because a
            beverage can have associated one or more recipes/ reviews and offers
            posted by the users of the application. We also associated Beverage
            class with class Country through an object property that indicates
            the provenance(s) of the beverage. Beverage was also connected to
            class Category and to class Ingredient. Among beverage information is included 
            the url from Open Food Facts where the beverage description can be found.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class Recipe</span>. Recipes are
            associated with the beverage category (eg.: Smoothie, Milkshake, Tea,
            etc.) via a data property. This association was possible due to the
            fact that we applied filters for the category of beverage recipe
            before extracting recipes from EDAMAM. Recipe class also includes
            data properties such as recipe source (the website from where the
            recipe was posted) and recipe url to the original recipe from
            EDAMAM. 
          </li>

              aspects</span
            >.
            
              Both beverages and recipes have associated ingredients,
              nutritional information (22 indicators, such as calories,
              calciumContent, sugarContent, vitaminAContent, vitaminB6Content,
              etc.) and health labels.
              
              We created the set nutritional information and the set of health
              labels by correlating information regarding these that we found
              in Open Food Facts and Edamam. The association between the names
              of health labels (and the names of nutrition information
              indicators) was made by hand.
              
              The set of ingredients from both data sources was also merged.
              Thus, we created and used the same convention over both products
              and recipes.
            
          </li>
          <li><span class="highlight-term">class Review </span>
            The Review class describes reviews about beverages posted by the users of the application.
            Data properties associated with this class include starRating and reviewDescription (the rating and 
            actual review given by a user). Reviews are directly correlated to beverages via an object property.
          </li>
          <li><span class="highlight-term">class Offer </span>
            The Offer class describes offers of beverages added by the users of the application. 
            Data properties associated with this class include offerDescription, offerPrice, offerQuantity, priceCurrency and 
            a property indicating the category of beverage for which the offer is posted (for example Lemon Juice/ Coffee).
          </li>
          <li><span class="highlight-term">class Score</span>
            This class indicates the score that a user associates with different beverages and/or recipes.
            It helps in indicating the preferences of a user for certain beverages/recipes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term"
              >Integration between scores and beverages, recipes, reviews and offers
            </span>
            The figure below depicts the association between scores and beverages, recipes, reviews and offers.
            Classes are denoted by circles, data properties by green rectangles, object properties by arrows, individuals
            by purple rectangles and naming convention of individuals by orange rectangles. 

            <p>Thus, offers are associated with beverage categories via isOfferFor data property. Relationship between 
            offers and users who post the offer is made with the use of direct and inverse object properties: hasOfferOwner and ownsOffer.
            Each offer instance name includes the email of the user posting the offer and the beverage category for which the offer is posted
            (eg.: Tea, Coffee).
           </p>
 
           <p>
             Reviews are associated both to Person and Beverage class via object properties. The name of review instances includes
             the email of the user making the review and the code of the beverage for which the review is being made.
           </p>

           <p>Individuals from both Beverage and Recipe class can have associated scores. 
              These scores are added by users in order to indicate their preference of certain beverages and/or recipes.
              The association is made via the Score class and object properties hasScore and its inverse, hasItemCode, that 
              connect beverage and recipe instances with associated score instances. Classes Score and Person are also connected via
              a set of direct and inverse object properties. The name of score individuals includes the email of the user giving the score,
              the entity type for which the score is given (Recipe/Beverage) and the code of the item for which the score is attributed (a beverage/recipe code).
              Score class is also connected to Type property in order to search for and filter more efficiently scores for beverages from scores from recipes.

            is 500k. Because of this limitation text was translated as words,
            not as full text. The algorithm, show in the diagram bellow, is
            build for character efficiency and data integrity while also
            providing a way to store the progress of translation in the middle
            of execution. The total amount of characters from the texts that
            needed to be translated was 2.4 millions, but with the help of the
            algorithm it was reduced to 470k, just within bounds for the DeepL
            API to be a viable solution.

        <p>
          The final step for creating our knowledge base was to aggregate the
          sanitized and translated datasets into our ontological model. In order
          to to this, we used the
          <a href="https://github.com/protegeproject/cellfie-plugin">Cellfie</a>
          Protégé plugin which converts spreadsheet data (excels) into OWL
          format. We created the transformation rules using
          <a
            href="https://github.com/protegeproject/mapping-master/wiki/MappingMasterDSL"
            >MappingMaster language</a
          >, a language which describes possible excel to OWL mappings. There
          was a total of 11 general rules (3 for recipe data, 6 for products
          data and 2 for nationalities and countries). The process of
          aggregation of all data was very slow (a few days) because of the
          large sizes of the datasets and the multitude of realized mappings.

      <h2>How our solution conforms to Linked Data Principles</h2>
      <p>
        Below are some reasons regarding why we consider that our proposed
        solution follows the Linked Data Principles:
      </p>
      <ul id="linked-data-principles-conformation-reasons">
        <li>
          We use a knowledge model (an ontology) in order to model the data in
          our application (OWL is language is built on top of RDF, so the
          modelling respects the linked data principles).
        </li>
        <li>
          When defining the ontological model, we tried as much as possible to
          reuse existing vocabularies and ontologies (details
          <a href="#ontological-model-used-vocabularies">here</a>). This
          increases reusability and increases the value of our model because of
          its interconnections with well-known vocabularies and ontologies.
        </li>
        <li>
          We use URIs for identifying any resources from the knowledge base.
          Therefore, beverage products, recipes, offers, reviews and most of
          their properties (ex: images) are/will be all identified by URIs. We
          will also use URIs for identifying other resources (non-informational)
          that will be part of our application.
        </li>
        <li>
          We use/will use HTTP schema when defining URIs for the resources in
          our application (for example, this is already true for all of the URIs
          in our knowledge base).

          Users of the application will be provided various useful related
          metadata when accessing one of the resources in our application (For
          example, the user will have access to nutritional information, health
          labels when accessing a beverage). We will also include important
          related information (For example, for a given recipe, the user will
          have access to the website from where the recipe was collected). We
          already ensured we can do these things mentioned above because of the
          way we have designed our knowledge base.

          are treated the same in terms of operations (the user can

          and reviews are also treated the same in terms of operations (the user
          ca view/add/update/delete an offer or a review). This service requires

        <h3>Initial Goals</h3>
        <section id="ig-intro">
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            The project started from the idea of having an app where users could
            socially interact with one another through the means of beverages
            and recipes from a large and wide variety. The plan was to have a
            very modular SOA architecture very adaptable and be future proof in
            terms of adaptability in every aspect: data, microservices, backend
            and frontend.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="requirements">
          <h4>Requirements</h4>
          <p>
            Having a goal, we decided go through the requirement analysis stage
            with an end user mindset. This resulted in the following
            specifications:
          </p>
          <p>The actors consist in a list of non managed entities:</p>
          <ol id="nm-entitites">
            <li>User Not Authenticated</li>
            <li>User Authenticated</li>
            <li>Email Services</li>
          </ol>
          <p>And a series of managed entities:</p>
          <ol id="m-entitites">
            <li>Stardog Database Manager</li>
            <li>Beverage Profile Microservice</li>
            <li>User Profile Microservice</li>
            <li>Search & Filter Microservice</li>
            <li>Recommendations Microservice</li>
            <li>Authentication</li>
            <li>Back End Gateway</li>
            <li>Front End Client</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Each of the managed entities have their own requirements that were
            made in the end user behavior in mind, fact which allowed a lot of
            scalability and modifications at develop time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The requirements for the <b>Front End</b> (also presented as
            <b>Main Application</b>) is to orchestrate the interaction between
            the user and the other services, and also to provide a user
            interface.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ones for the <b>Back End Gateway</b> are to unite and manage all
            of the microservices and provide the upper layer (in this case,
            Front End) with an easier solution to access the data and semantics
            provided by the microservices
          </p>

          <p>
            The <b>Beverage Profile</b> microservice had the initial
            requirements of:
          </p>
          <ol id="bp-req">
            <li>
              As an authenticated user, I want to be able to add/update/delete
              positive or negative feedback (score) regarding beverages
            </li>

            <li>
              As an authenticated user, I want to see the list of beverages for
              which I have submitted feedback
            </li>

            <li>
              As an authenticated user, I want to add/update/delete reviews
              regarding beverages
            </li>

            <li>
              As an authenticated user, I want to add/update/delete offers
              regarding beverages
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The <b>Search and Filter</b> microservice had the initial
            requirements of:
          </p>
          <ol id="sf-req">
            <li>
              As an authenticated user, I want to search entities (beverages,
              users, reviews, offers etc..) while also having the possibility to
              filter the results at each step.
            </li>

            <li>
              As an authenticated user, I want to be able to save and access the
              filters for the current search as a personal search group.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The <b>Recommendation</b> microservice had the initial requirements
            of:
          </p>
          <ol id="r-req">
            <li>
              As an authenticated user, I want to receive recommendations on
              beverages on my feed which are made based on
              similarities/correlations between my metadata and other users
              metadata
            </li>

            <li>
              As an authenticated user, I want to configure my recommendations
              with some filters
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The <b>User Profile</b> microservice had the simple requirement to
            manage the metadata of the user non related to the beverages, such
            as age, name, surname etc..
