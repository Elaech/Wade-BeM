      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The user guide provides insights on how to use
        the software built within the project and a presentation video
        that describes all of the aspects present in the present
        as well as some of the technicalities and implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implemented architecture is meant to be used by both
        humans and robots by making use of the beverage manager
        front end client and of the backend gateway GraphQL API.  
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="audience">
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The main target audience of the application consists in 
        the users that will
        manually interact with the front end of the application. The
        usage is defined by searching, filtering and 
        viewing beverages, recipes, offers, reviews,
        recommendations or other users and creating offers, reviews,
        metadata, beverage and/or recipe scores.
      </p>
      <p>Also part of the beach head, are the users AI's and robots
        that parse web content and try to obtain information from it
        or its corresponding interactions. The usage incorporates the
        one for the human user as well as the usage of the GraphQL
        API provided by the back end gateway.
      </p>

    <section id="integration-frontend">
        <h2>BeM Client Usage</h2>
        <p>The front end is composed of several individual
          pages that each represent some form of entity behind
          the scenes.

          <p>The search and filter page provides initially a table that contains the all of the entities from

            by providing a keyword in the text input residing in the top right corner, sorting the items by any of the
          columns and as well as providing the option to filter the results by the value of each one of the column values.
          A quality of life feature is the reset on all the filters.</p>
          <p>The table contains all the metadata associated with the beverages/reviews/offers/recipes,
            unlike the other pages, which makes the application respect the

      will be automatically logged off. </p>
      <p>Another problem that could occur is if
        the user tries to access routes that are not open;
        in this case the solution being a redirect to the login
        page, which will authorize the user and in turn transport him
        to the homepage if the authentication is still valid.

      <p> The user can manually log out of the application if he presses
        the logout button situated in the navbar.

      <h2>GraphQL API Usage</h2>
      <p>Bellow, there can be seen two examples of how one might use the 
        GrahQL API to acquire data directly from the back end gateway.
        There are many usages, such as data scrapping or integration with another app,
        that can be achieved very easily because of the GraphQL API provided by the gateway.
        A quality of life feature comes from the fact that the GraphQL technology used allows users
        to experiment in a graphical manner, making the whole thing self documented in a way which
        not many APIs can be.

      <h2>Use Cases Examples</h2>
      <section id="scenario1">
        <h2>Simple Human and Beverage Interaction</h2>
        <p>This is represented by the main scenario of the application
          and is put into practice by any user that wants to create an
        account and use our functionalities for searching beverages, recipes
      or other things that are related in order to gain more knowledge about
    the beverage world that could suit his tastes. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="scenario2">
        <h2>API Integration into another Project</h2>
        <p>Because the gateway is made the way it is, another
          developer might want to integrate our entire functionality
          into his own application. This is another powerful usecase that
          is put into the spotlight by the well implemented gateway and
          as well as the very big semantic database that we have built; all tied
          together by the Open Linked Data principles that were respected.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="scenario3">
        <h2>Data Scrapping or Collecting</h2>
        <p>Because the gateway is made the way it is, another
          person can, if he builds a scrapper, parse the entirety of our
          database and scrap whatever data is needed for their project. This
          can be done in real time, if the data amount needed is small or
          is needed at somewhat high time intervals but can also be compacted into
          a real data science dataset. The dataset usage could constitute to
          research on human and beverage behavior or just simple study the 
          beverage and recipe types and their metadata.
