      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>This report describes preliminary considerations regarding our <a href="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/wade/web-projects.html">WADE project</a>, Beverage Manager. 
        We describe the general structure of our proposed solution, the technologies (Web services, APIs, triple store(s) etc.) 
        that will be managed or used by our application. We also provide details about our ontological model and about the process
         of creating the knowledge base (collection, sanitization, translation and aggregation of data).  
         We conclude by giving reasons why we think our solution conforms to Linked Data Principles.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Our application will use a single knowledge base both for user and beverages (meta-)data storage. 
        This knowledge base will interact with our Search & Filter, Beverage Profile, User Profile and Recommendations services.
       The process of data collection is described in section X, whereas the steps for creating the knowledge base are discussed 
       in section Y. A description of the ontological model is given in section Z. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="technologies">
     <h2>Web services, APIs and other technologies used as part of the application</h2>
     <p>In order to build our application we will use:</p>
     <ul id="technologies-list">
        <li><a href="https://www.stardog.com/">Stardog</a>. This is our choice of a triplestore. We will store in Stardog our created knowledge base 
          and use it in order to perform SPARQL queries, inferences, etc. 
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry">Google Container Registry</a> & <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Google Cloud Run</a>. 
          We will use these services in order to deploy our knowledge base in Google Cloud. 
          Starting with a local Stardog Docker image, we will store it in the cloud with Google Container Registry and we will further create
          and run the resulted container using Google Cloud Run.
       </li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>. We will use Firebase in order to authenticate users and perform related tasks
          such as email verificationwhen a new user registers on our platform. 
        </li>
     </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="external-data">
      <h2>External data sources used for building the knowledge base</h2>
      <p>In order to build the knowledge base for our project, we collected data from public API(s), open database(s) and other datasets. 
        The used data sources are as follows: </p>
      <ul id="external-data-sources">
          <li property="schema:Dataset"><a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts database</a></li>
          <li property="schema:WebAPI"><a href="https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api">EDAMAM recipe API</a></li>
          <li property="schema:Dataset">Public (small) datasets (<a href="https://untermportal.un.org/unterm/download/country">list of countries</a>
          & <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664133/CH_Nationality_List_20171130_v1.csv/preview">
          nationalities)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Before creating the knowledge-base we also tested (and considered using) APIs such as: </p>
      <ul id="external-data-sources-not-used">
        <li property="schema:WebAPI"><a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">Spoonacular API</a></li>
        <li property="schema:WebAPI"><a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php">CocktailDb API </a></li>
        <li property="schema:WebAPI"><a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html">FoodData Central API</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Next, we will discuss only about the data sources actually used in our application.</p>
      <section id="open-food-facts">
        <h3>Open Food Facts database</h3>
        <p >From here we extracted data regarding most common (not necessarily disjoint) categories of non-alcoholic beverage products.
           In case of beverages with a potential small alcohol content, we checked that the alcohol by volume value is below 1% (chosen convention).
            The table below summarizes the number of products extracted for each category.

        <p>In case of juices and nectars categories we further split them in subcategories (AppleJuice, PearNectar, etc.) so that we could correlate
           these drinks in the future with the associated names of fruits and vegetables. The data was downloaded in csv and excel formats.

        <h3>EDAMAM recipe API</h3>
        <p>We used this API in order to extract data regarding non-alcoholic beverage recipes.
           We chose it because it offered a high amount of quality data (beverage recipes along with associated URI, image, ingredients,
           calories and detailed nutritional information).  Recipes are also split by categories: <i>Smoothie</i>, <i>Syrup</i>, <i>Tea</i>,
           <i>Coffee</i>, <i>Chocolate Drink</i>,  <i>Juice</i>, <i>Milkshake</i>.
           We automatically extracted the data using a script (because at one request we could only extract 20 recipes and we could only make 10 requests
           per minute). The total number of extracted recipes was <span style="color: var(--light-brown);font-weight: bold;">17714</span>. The data was downloaded in excel format.

        Scholarly HTML would like to thank
        <a href="http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly HTML</a>
        (you read that right) for blazing the trail perhaps a few years too
        soon. Particularly, the following people were particularly kind and

        Dan Brickley was kind enough to drop by the office to chat about our
        usage of
        <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> even though he was tired and
        hungry. As always, examples involving fish tanks are the most helpful.
        Dave Cramer shared ideas that we happily stole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patrick Johnston’s input has been crucial, notably in modeling
        authoring. We can only hope that getting those details exactly right
        have not caused him to lose too much sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also received very useful feedback and pointers from: Kjetil Kjernsmo
        (DAHUT!), Silvio Peroni, Justin Johansson, Alf Eaton, Raniere Silvia,
        Kaveh Bazargan and Mike Smith. We are very much indebted to the help
        provided us by Ivan Herman.

        If we somehow forgot you in this list and you are too gracious to
        complain, we love you all the same.
