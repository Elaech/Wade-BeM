        that will be managed or used by our application. We also provide details
        about our ontological model and about the process of creating the
        knowledge base (collection, sanitization, translation and aggregation of
        data). We conclude by giving reasons why we think our solution conforms
        to Linked Data Principles.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Our application will use a single knowledge base both for user and
        beverages (meta-)data storage. This knowledge base will interact with
        our Search & Filter, Beverage Profile, User Profile and Recommendations
        services. The process of data collection is described in section X,
        whereas the steps for creating the knowledge base are discussed in
        section Y. A description of the ontological model is given in section Z.

          quality data (beverage recipes along with associated URI, image,
          ingredients, calories and detailed nutritional information). Recipes
          are also split by categories: <i>Smoothie</i>, <i>Syrup</i>,
          <i>Tea</i>, <i>Coffee</i>, <i>Chocolate Drink</i>, <i>Juice</i>,
          <i>Milkshake</i>. We automatically extracted the data using a script
          (because at one request we could only extract 20 recipes and we could
          only make 10 requests per minute). The total number of extracted
          recipes was <span class="highlight-term">17714</span>. The data was

        We created the ontology using
        <a href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">Protégé</a>. Some metrics about
        out ontological model can be found below:

          As a mention, we uploaded data into our ontology (in order to create
          the knowledge base) semi-automatically using a plugin named
          <a href="https://github.com/protegeproject/cellfie-plugin">Cellfie</a>
          (details in

        <h3>Ontological model description</h3>
        <p>
          We described categories of beverages through a hierarchy of classes
          (corresponding to categories from table 1). We opted for this type of
          modelling in order to ensure an easy extension of the ontology in the
          future, in case of adding other subcategories or categories of drinks.
          The root class of this taxonomy is class Beverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case of beverages such as juices and nectar we decided to define
          subcategories by splitting these beverages based on the kind(s) of
          fruits and/or vegetables they contain (ex: AppleJuice, PearNectar,
          etc.). We correlated these subclasses with classes Fruit and Vegetable
          through object properties isMadeOfFruit and isMadeOfVegetable. Figure
          2 highlights the subclasses representing types of beverages:

        <p>
          Next, we will provide a general overview on classes and their
          associated properties (data properties and object properties) we used
          in our model:
        </p>
        <ul id="ontology-description-classes-and-properties">
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">classes Country and Nationality</span>.
            Useful for describing beverage provenance, the country where a user
            lives in or the user’s nationality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class Beverage</span>. We associated
            this class with classes Review, Recipe, Offer because a beverage can
            have associated one or more reviews, recipes, offers. We also
            associated it with class Country through an object property that
            indicates the provenance(s) of the beverage. Beverage was also
            connected to class Category and to class Ingredient (connections
            explained below).

            <p>
              Both beverages and recipes have associated nutritional information
              (22 indicators, such as calories, calciumContent, sugarContent,
              vitaminAContent, vitaminB6Content, etc.) and a health label (that
              indicate the existence or non-existence of an important or
              potentially dangerous ingredient in the beverage or a certain
              property of the beverage, for example: milk-free, for-vegans,
              guarana-extract, etc.). We created the set nutritional information
              and the set of health labels by hand, by correlating information
              regarding these that we found in Open Food Facts and Edamam. Thus,
              we created and used the same convention over both products and
              recipes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class HealthLabel</span>. Defines the
            health labels that are used to describe beverages and recipes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class Ingredient</span>. Associated
            with classes Beverage and Recipe, describes the ingredients that a
            beverage/recipe can have.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class Category</span>. Defines the
            fine-grained categories that a beverage can belong to. We used the
            hierarchy of classes for defining main classes of beverages, but we
            also needed a mechanism to associate more expressive and/or detailed
            categories to beverages (such as squeezed-juices, instant-coffees,
            flavoured-syrups, etc.). These categories have been previously
            collected from the data extracted from Open Food Facts. It was
            almost impossible and impractical to model all of those categories
            as a set of classes, so we decided to create this new class to
            capture the small categories that a beverage can have.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">class Person</span>. Models the user
            information. This class is connected through object properties with
            classes Nationality, Country, HealthRestriction, meaning that a user
            with a certain nationality lives in a certain country and may have
            some health restrictions (such as lactose intolerance or diabetes).
            We also defined object properties to express the fact that a user
            may have one or more beverage preferences and/or one or more
            beverage category preferences (for example: a user prefers
            plant-based products). Person is also connected to classes Recipe,
            Offer and Review with object properties that express the fact that a
            user can add a review for a beverage, make a beverage offer or add a
            beverage recipe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight-term">classes Recipe, Offer, Review</span>.
            Connected to class Person and Beverage as explained above. Recipes,
            offers and reviews have all a description and an associated score
            (as data properties). Offers have among others price as a data
            property, while recipes have URIs to images, URI to source (from
            where the recipe was collected) and other data properties.

      <h2>Data Modifications. Creating the knowledge base</h2>
      We will further describe the data processing and aggregation steps that we
      had to go through in order to obtain the knowledge base.

        <h3>Aggregation and final outcome</h3>
        <p>
          The final step for creating our knowledge base was to aggregate the
          sanitized and translated datasets into our ontological model. In order
          to to this, we used the
          <a href="https://github.com/protegeproject/cellfie-plugin">Cellfie</a>
          Protégé plugin which converts spreadsheet data (excels) into OWL
          format. We created the transformation rules using
          <a
            href="https://github.com/protegeproject/mapping-master/wiki/MappingMasterDSL"
            >MappingMaster language</a
          >, a language which describes possible excel to OWL mappings. There
          was a total of 11 general rules (3 for recipe data, 6 for products
          data and 2 for nationalities and countries). The process of
          aggregation of all data was very slow (a few days) because of the
          large sizes of the datasets and the multitude of realized mappings.

    <section id="linked-data-principles-conformation">
      <h2>How our solution conforms to Linked Data Principles</h2>
      <p>
        Below are some reasons regarding why we consider that our proposed
        solution follows the Linked Data Principles:
      </p>
      <ul id="linked-data-principles-conformation-reasons">
        <li>
          We use a knowledge model (an ontology) in order to model the data in
          our application (OWL is language is built on top of RDF, so the
          modelling respects the linked data principles).
        </li>
        <li>
          When defining the ontological model, we tried as much as possible to
          reuse existing vocabularies and ontologies (details
          <a href="#ontological-model-used-vocabularies">here</a>). This
          increases reusability and increases the value of our model because of
          its interconnections with well-known vocabularies and ontologies.
        </li>
        <li>
          We use URIs for identifying any resources from the knowledge base.
          Therefore, beverage products, recipes, offers, reviews and most of
          their properties (ex: images) are/will be all identified by URIs. We
          will also use URIs for identifying other resources (non-informational)
          that will be part of our application.
        </li>
        <li>
          We use/will use HTTP schema when defining URIs for the resources in
          our application (for example, this is already true for all of the URIs
          in our knowledge base).
        </li>
        <li>
          Users of the application will be provided various useful related
          metadata when accessing one of the resources in our application (For
          example, the user will have access to nutritional information, health
          labels when accessing a beverage). We will also include important
          related information (For example, for a given recipe, the user will
          have access to the website from where the recipe was collected). We
          already ensured we can do these things mentioned above because of the
          way we have designed our knowledge base.
